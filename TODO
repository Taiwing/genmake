- add an auto-update/auto-install script
- check that a directory is well formated (check_format.py script)
- If it is not well formatted and that --format is not set, it should leave
  with an error being printed. It should also leave if subfolders exist beyond
  the first level and that they are not declared as subprojects or if the
  --recursive option is not set
- create a --recursive option to create makefiles recursively if subproject are
  declared (options from the first genmake call will have to be passed) and
  maybe another one to prevent genmake from getting into certain subfolders
- add a --format option to format the project dir if it is not compliant with
  genmake's requirements, it should move every header to a includes/ directory
  that will be created if it doesn't exist, and also every C files/C folders
  to a src/ dir. It should also change the #include directives if they refer
  to a header in includes/ with a path so that it only takes the name.
- handle subprojects completely and add a "fuselib" option to compile every
  sub libraries into one, to get rid of dependency issues (like if ft_printf
  depends on libft, and as does the main project which depends on ft_printf
  and another subproject, so how do I handle libft ?)

Pre-requisites:
	- the project must be developped in C
	- there must be a src/ directory where all the C files will be (either
	  directly at the root of the directory or in subdirectories)
	- 1 is the level max of subdirectories permitted in src/ except if a
	subdirectory is specified as a subproject
	- if there are subprojects they are supposed to have Makefiles with
	the rules required by 42's norme (except if --recursive is set)
	- the headers will be in a directory named includes/ located
	at the root of the project
	- every include directive of a source header must not include the path,
	only the file name
	- if any of these requirements are not met, genmake will not be able to
	produce a working makefile for the project

usage: genmake [path] [-h] [-t type] [-n name]
options:
		-h | --help:    Print this.
		-t | --type:    The next argument is the type
				of the target that the generated
				makefile will create. That value
				can be 'exec 'or 'lib', where the
				first one refers to a program, and
				the second to a library (compiles
				a program by default).
		-n | --name:    Name of the target ('exec' by default
				or 'lib.a' if type is 'lib'). A suffix
				'.a' will be added to the name if the
				type of the target is 'lib' and the
				extension is not present.
		-v | --verbose:	Print additional information.

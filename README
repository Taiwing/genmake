# 0: pre-requisites:
#	- the project must be developped in C
#	- there must be a src/ directory where all the C files will be (either
#	  directly at the root of the directory or in subdirectories)
#	- 1 is the level max of subdirectories permitted in src/
#	- the headers will be in a directory named includes/ located
#	  at the root of the project
#	- every include directive of a source header must not include the path,
#	  only the file name
#	- if any of these requirements are not met, genmake will not be able to
#	  produce a working makefile for the project

# 1: move/copy the genmake folder to the root of the project directory
# 2: simply type 'make' in genmake/ to generate the Makefile for a program

# 3: options:
#		- TYPE: type can be set to either "exec" or "lib", if it is set to
#		  "lib" the Makefile generated by genmake will compile a library
#		  (if it is set to any other value, it will compile a program)
#		- TARG: target can be set to any value and will be the value of the
#		  NAME variable in the final Makefile (if it is an "exec" type, the
#		  default NAME will be "exec", if it is a "lib" type, the default
#		  NAME will be "lib.a", also if a TARG is given without the ".a"
#		  suffix it will be added be genmake)
#	they can be set when executing 'make' by adding 'TYPE=value' or
#	'TARG=value', example: 'make TYPE=lib TARG=libft.a'
